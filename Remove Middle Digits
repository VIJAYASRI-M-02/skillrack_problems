An integer N is passed as the input to the program. 
The program must remove the digits between the first and last digit of N. 
Then the program must print the modified N as the output. 
Boundary Condition(s): 
        100 <= N <= 10^9 
Input Format:   
        The first line contains N. 
Output Format: 
        The first line contains the modified N. 
Example Input/Output 1: 
        Input: 4785 
        Output: 45 
        Explanation: The digits between the first and last digit are 7 and 8. 
        Which are removed and printed as 45. 
Example Input/Output 2: 
        Input: 543158 
        Output: 58
        
        
 #include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    char s[100];
    scanf("%s",s);
    int n=strlen(s);
    printf("%c%c",s[0],s[n-1]);

}
