The program must accept two integers X representing the voltage supplied from a socket and Y representing the voltage required by a television. 
The television can stabilize voltage variations of plus or minus 50 units. 
The program must print yes if the television can work if plugged into the socket. 
Else the program must print no as the output. 

Boundary Condition(s): 
50 <= X, Y <= 1000 

Input Format: 
The first line contains X and Y separated by space. 

Output Format: 
The first line contains yes or no. 
Example Input/Output 1:
Input: 
220 260 

Output: 
yes 

Explanation: 
The voltage supplied from the socket is 40 less than the required voltage (260) which can be stabilized by the television. 
So yes is printed as the output. 

Example Input/Output 2: 
Input: 150 205 
Output: no



#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int x,y;
    scanf("%d %d",&x,&y);
    if(abs(x-y)<=50){
        printf("yes");
    }
    else
    printf("no");

}
