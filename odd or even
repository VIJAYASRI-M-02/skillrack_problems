DAILY CHALLENGE 
Odd or Even - 1 or 2 

The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must replace all the even digits in N by 1 and replace all the odd digits in N by 2. Then the program must print the modified value of N as the output. 
Boundary Condition(s): 
  1 <= N <= 10^9 
Input Format: 
  The first line contains the value of N. 
Output Format: 
  The first line contains the modified value of N. 
Example Input/Output 1: 
  Input: 465189 
  Output: 112212 
  Explanation: All the even digits are in 465189 are replaced by 1. 
  All the odd digits are in 465189 are replaced by 2. 
  Hence the output is 112212 
Example Input/Output 2: 
  Input: 212112 
  Output: 121221
  
  
  int main()
{
    char s[100000];
    scanf("%s",s);
    for(int i=0;i<strlen(s);i++){
        if((s[i]-'0')%2==0){
            s[i]='1';
        }
        else{
            s[i]='2';
        }
    }
    printf("%s",s);

}
