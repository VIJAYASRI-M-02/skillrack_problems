the program must accept the shape and dimensions of n objects as the input. 
the program must print the sum of the area of all the objects as the output. 
the shape can be square or rectangle. 

boundary condition(s): 
1 <= n <= 1000 

input format: 
the first line contains n.
the next n lines contain the shape followed by dimension(s) side for square and length and breadth for rectangle separated by a space. 

output format: the first line contains the sum of the area of all the objects.

example input/output 1: 

input: 
4 
square 5 
rectangle 4 2
rectangle 3 10 
square 11 

output: 184 
explanation: 
the first object is square it's area is 5*5 = 25. the total area is 25. the second object is rectangle it's area is 4*2 = 8. the total area is 33. the third object is rectangle it's area is 3*10 = 30. the total area is 63. the fourth object is square it's area is 11*11 = 121. the total area is 184. 

example input/output 2:
input: 
6 
square 25
rectangle 17 24 
square 5 
rectangle 40 12 
square 34 
square 48

output: 4998

python:

n=int(input())
s=0
for i in range(n):
  inputs=str(input()).split()
  if(inputs[0]=='square'):
    a=int(inputs[1])
    s+=(a*a)
  else:
    a=int(inputs[1])
    b=int(inputs[2])
    s+=(a*b)
print(s)

c:
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
   int n,a,b,sum=0;
   scanf("%d",&n):
   for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
   int k=scanf("%s %d %d",s,&a,&b);
   if(k==2)
   sum+=a*a;
   else
   sum+=a*b;
    }
    printf("%d",sum);
    

    return 0;
}
